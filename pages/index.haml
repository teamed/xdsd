        %p
          XDSD is an open software development methodology that aims
          to reduce risks and improve quality in a project of almost any size.
          There are four fundamental principles:
        %ul
          %li Everyone gets paid for verified deliverables
          %li Defects are planned and don't block delivery
          %li Quality-of-code metrics are CI gate conditions
          %li Master branch is read-only
